    <h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
    
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://owltastic.com/" target="_blank">Meagan Fisher's Website</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.alessandroferrini.it/" target="_blank">Alessanro Ferrini's Website</a></li>
        <em>That's just to name a couple.</em>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>

    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <span>Space</span>

          <ul>
            <li> 
                <em>owltastic</em>  
                <p> The use of whitespace in this website is vey ideal.  As a user visiting the website, I do not feel bombarded with information and I feel like there is room to breath.  My attention is directed to the elements on the webpage and I am not distracted by the background.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <em>alessandroferrini</em>
                <p> In this websites, there is a generous amount of negative space.  As you can see, the background image does not draw much attention and gives the eyes a place to rest.  The infomation the web owner wants to relay is placed in the center of the website; easy for the eyes to target and receive.  I really like how there is a lot of breathing room in this site as well and how information / elements are not crowding.
                </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

        </li>

        <li>
          <span>Size</span>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>owltastic</em>
              <p> The size in the website is overall convenient.  The headings are easy to spot and the text sizes corresponds to the importance of information. 
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <em>alessandroferrini</em>
              <p> For this second website, the text size is comfortable for the eyes to read and he has also made some keywords bold.  It is also notable that the line length of his text are kept to a minimum and pleasing to a reader's eyes.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <span>Balance</span>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>owltastic</em>
              <p> The overall feel of this website is balanced.  It is kind of hard for me to explain, but I will try.  The whole page (seems like) is divided into five sections with the use of the different background color; per section, you can see that there is balance and as a result gives the overall look of the website that balance.  The elements per section, although in some are different in shape, has a counterpart on the other side of it.  You can also see the sides are equally spaced.
              </p>
            </li> 

            <li>
              <em>alessandroferrini</em>
              <p> This website has achieved symmetrical balance by centering.  You can see the information (text) and elements are conveniently located in the middle of the page.  The web designer was able to do centering without leaving the website plain and boring.  He made use of the transition and display of elements along with his background very well to add class to the website.  
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <!-- heyyyallie/home -->
        <strong>Heyyyallie/home</strong><br/>
        <img src="images/sketch/home.jpg" width="40%">
        <p>In the home page your attention is brought to the center.  The focal point of the page would be the header image dominating the top of the webpage.  The page will be divided into three parts with the use of different background color per section, similar to <a href="http://owltastic.com/" target="_blank">Meagan Fisher's Website</a>.  Per section, I used centering and you will see elements are balanced.  Hierarchy is seen with the flow of the website; as the webdeveloper (to be), I want the visitors of the page to first see the website name and learn a little about me, from there I want to share my blog posts as I love to write, and then at the last section I shared my social media links.  Footer will contain footer links and copyright. </p>
        <br/><br/><br/><br/>   
      </li>

      <li>
        <!-- heyyyallie/home-active -->
        <strong>Heyyyallie/home with Active Menu</strong><br/>
        <img src="images/sketch/active-menu.jpg" width="40%"> 
        <p>I have chosen the <strong>open door transition</strong> to show the menu options when the menu button at the top left is active.</p>
        <br/><br/><br/><br/> 
      </li>

      <li>
        <!-- heyyyallie/about -->
        <strong>Heyyyallie/about</strong><br/>
        <img src="images/sketch/about.jpg" width="40%">  
        <p>Again, in this page (ABOUT) I have chosen centering.  Aside from the clean look the negative space offers, the focus of the viewer is sent to the middle of the page and from bottom to top.  I have also chosen to add a map below the description/ about me paragraph to show the different places I have lived at and the places I have been to.</p>
        <br/><br/><br/><br/> 
      </li>

      <li>
        <!-- heyyyallie/blog -->
        <strong>Heyyyallie/blog</strong><br/>
        <img src="images/sketch/blog.jpg" width="40%"> 
        <p>The meat of my website will be my blog; as I have mentioned I do love to write.  The header is smaller than that of the homepage header as to give space for the blog posts that will follow below it.  A big header for this type of page will look heavy (I think).  As this page will contain more text than the other pages, I have chosen to shorten the line length to encourage the visitors to read on, giving a "short read" look when you glance over the post.  The blog posts may also contain images which I will like to display before the blog posts, just below the blog title; sort of like a mini-header effect.  On the right you will see a column that allows you to view blog posts by Category or you may choose to view old posts by date under Archive.  And the same as the other pages, the flow of the website is obvious and easy for the eyes to navigate from top to bottom and then left to right.  It may seem page is a little off balance with the negative space on the left being more than that of the right, but I feel the image on the top left balances that off.</p>
