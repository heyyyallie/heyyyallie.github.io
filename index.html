    <h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
    
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://owltastic.com/" target="_blank">Meagan Fisher's Website</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.alessandroferrini.it/" target="_blank">Alessanro Ferrini's Website</a></li>
        <em>That's just to name a couple.</em>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>

    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <span>Space</span>

          <ul>
            <li> 
                <em>owltastic</em>  
                <p> The use of whitespace in this website is vey ideal.  As a user visiting the website, I do not feel bombarded with information and I feel like there is room to breath.  My attention is directed to the elements on the webpage and I am not distracted by the background.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <em>alessandroferrini</em>
                <p> In this websites, there is a generous amount of negative space.  As you can see, the background image does not draw much attention and gives the eyes a place to rest.  The infomation the web owner wants to relay is placed in the center of the website; easy for the eyes to target and receive.  I really like how there is a lot of breathing room in this site as well and how information / elements are not crowding.
                </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

        </li>

        <li>
          <span>Size</span>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>owltastic</em>
              <p> The size in the website is overall convenient.  The headings are easy to spot and the text sizes corresponds to the importance of information. 
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <em>alessandroferrini</em>
              <p> For this second website, the text size is comfortable for the eyes to read and he has also made some keywords bold.  It is also notable that the line length of his text are kept to a minimum and pleasing to a reader's eyes.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <span>Balance</span>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>owltastic</em>
              <p> The overall feel of this website is balanced.  It is kind of hard for me to explain, but I will try.  The whole page (seems like) is divided into five sections with the use of the different background color; per section, you can see that there is balance and as a result gives the overall look of the website that balance.  The elements per section, although in some are different in shape, has a counterpart on the other side of it.  You can also see the sides are equally spaced.
              </p>
            </li> 

            <li>
              <em>alessandroferrini</em>
              <p> This website has achieved symmetrical balance by centering.  You can see the information (text) and elements are conveniently located in the middle of the page.  The web designer was able to do centering without leaving the website plain and boring.  He made use of the transition and display of elements along with his background very well to add class to the website.

        </li>
      </ol>
